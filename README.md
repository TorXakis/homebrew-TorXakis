# Homebrew tap for TorXakis

This repository is the homebrew tap of `TorXakis`. 

For macOS systems we provide a homebrew package. If you don't have the `homebrew` package manager installed on your macOS
system follow the installation instruction on the [homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/).


### Install `TorXakis` on macOS ###

To install `TorXakis` using this tap, use the following commands:

```sh
brew tap torxakis/torxakis
brew install torxakis
```
Homebrew will fetch a pre-build binary and do a quick installation. 
Homebrew will also install [SMT][1] solver [Z3][3] as runtime dependency of the  `TorXakis` package.

If you just have the newest MacOS version installed for which no pre-build binary is installed yet, then homebrew will install the pre-build binary from the previous MacOS version. In case this gives problems, which is improbable, then you can still force a build from source with the commands: 

```sh
brew tap torxakis/torxakis
brew install --build-from-source torxakis
```

To install the latest HEAD source of `TorXakis`, use the following commands: 

```sh
brew tap torxakis/torxakis
brew install --HEAD torxakis
```
There is no binary pre-build for the latest source, therefore homebrew will build and install `TorXakis` from that latest source itself.

### First run of `TorXakis` ###

After installing TorXakis you can do a first run and see that it can initialize Z3 correctly:

```sh
$ torxakis

TXS >>  TorXakis :: Model-Based Testing

TXS >>  txsserver starting: "localhost" : 53382
TXS >>  Solver "z3" initialized : Z3 [4.8.5]
TXS >>  TxsCore initialized
TXS >>  input files parsed:
TXS >>  []
TXS >>
```

With homebrew you can also do a very basic test to check torxakis starts up and does a simple evaluation:

```sh
$ brew test torxakis.rb
Testing torxakis
==> running basic test
==> printf "eval 33+7777777777777\nq" |torxakis  2>&1
==> test succesfull
```

### How to use `TorXakis` with CVC4 instead of Z3 on macOS

To install [CVC4][2], use the following commands: 

```sh
brew tap cvc4/cvc4
brew install cvc4
```

TorXakis can be configured by using a configuration file `.torxakis.yaml`.
The configuration file is expected either

* in the working directory or
* in the home directory.

The working directory has precedence over the latter. An example of a `.torxakis.yaml` file can be found in the `TorXakis` github repository at this [page][5].
   
To configure `TorXakis` to use [CVC4][2] instead of [Z3][3] we use the `~/.torxakis.yaml` configuration file to change the default [SMT][1] solver being used, which we can create  using the following commands:

```sh
echo 'selected-solver: "cvc4" ' > ~/.torxakis.yaml
```

From now on `TorXakis` will use [CVC4][2]  instead of [Z3][3].
 
### How to use specific versions of Z3 or CVC4 with `TorXakis`

Unfortunately Homebrew still doesnâ€™t have an obvious builtin way of installing an older version.

However there is an easy method to install older versions using versioned names, such as formula@version, in your custom tap.
Using [this method][6] you can install older versions of [CVC4][2]  or [Z3][3].
